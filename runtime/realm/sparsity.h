// sparsity maps for Realm

// NOTE: SparsityMap's are not intended to be manipulated directly by Realm
//  applications (including higher-level runtimes), but they make heavy use of
//  templating and inlining for performance, so the headers are "reachable" from
//  the external parts of the Realm API

#define REALM_SPARSITY_H

#include "realm/indexspace.h"

namespace Realm {

  template <int N, typename T /*= int*/> struct Point;

  template <int N, typename T = int> class HierarchicalBitMap;

  // a SparsityMap is a Realm handle to sparsity data for one or more index spaces - all
  //  SparsityMap's use the same ID namespace (i.e. regardless of N and T), but the
  //  template parameters are kept to avoid losing dimensionality information upon iteration/etc.

  // there are three layers to the SparsityMap onion:
  // a) SparsityMap is the Realm handle that (like all other handles) can be copied/stored
  //     whereever and represents a name for a distributed object with a known "creator" node,
  //     with valid data for the object existing on one or more nodes (which may or may not
  //     include the creator node) - methods on this "object" simply forward to the actual
  //     implementation object, described next
  // b) SparsityMapPublicImpl is the public subset of the storage and functionality of the actual
  //     sparsity map implementation - this should be sufficient for all the needs of user code,
  //     but not for Realm internals (e.g. the part that actually computes new sparsity maps) -
  //     these objects are not allocated directly
  // c) SparsityMapImpl is the actual dynamically allocated object that exists on each "interested"
  //     node for a given SparsityMap - it inherits from SparsityMapPublicImpl and adds the "private"
  //     storage and functionality - this separation is primarily to avoid the installed version of
  //     of Realm having to include all the internal .h files
